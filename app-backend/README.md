# Mom I'm Hungry Project

## Overview
### Mom I'm Hungry Project - Backend
This is the backend for the "Mom I'm Hungry" recipe web app. 
The goal of this project is to provide a robust API for managing recipes, ingredients, and filtering options. 
The app aims to make cooking easier by offering features like ingredient conversions, recipe filtering, and an "easy mode" for simplified measurements.

## Features

- **Recipe Filtering**:
    - Filter recipes by:
        - Country (e.g., BRA, SWE, US, UK, ITA)
        - Ingredient types (e.g., fruits, vegetables, protein, grains, dairy, spices)
        - Seasons (spring, summer, autumn, winter)
        - Meal type (e.g., snacks, desserts, salads, soups & broths, sauces, main courses, drinks)
        - Calories (Kcal)
        - Cooking duration (e.g., 1-15, 16-30, 31-45, 46+ minutes)

- **Ingredient Management**:
    - Store detailed information about ingredients:
        - Name, ID, measurement type, and calories
        - Example:
            - Apple: fruit, color, 36 kcal (per 100g or unit), measurement type: grams
            - Oil: fat, yellow, 100 kcal (per 100ml), measurement type: ml, with spoon conversion
            - Eggs: unit-based measurement (e.g., 3 eggs instead of 100g of eggs)

- **Easy Mode**:
    - Simplified ingredient measurements:
        - Convert liquids and spices to spoon sizes (e.g., teaspoons, tablespoons) or cups
        - Protein measurements in units (e.g., 1 chicken breast instead of 1kg chicken breast)
        - Special measurement units for specific ingredients (e.g., cloves of garlic)

## Future Updates

This README will be updated as the project evolves. Planned features include integration with external APIs for ingredient data and additional filtering options.

## Getting Started

To get started with the backend, clone the repository and follow the setup instructions (to be added in future updates).

Stay tuned for more updates!
